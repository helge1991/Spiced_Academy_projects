# Markov Simulation

Hint: This project was part of a group work. You can find the group project called "re-netto" [here](https://github.com/Kestener/re-netto-project).

Results of the project: 
- A program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket using Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC).
- The simulation models the way customers move through the supermarket's six areas: entrance, fruit, spices, dairy, drinks and checkout.
- It is possible to: Understand customer behavior, explain customer behavior to non-data staff, optimize staffing so that the queues do not get unnecessary long.

Tools used:
- Python-libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas
- Collaboration with Git: Create GitHub repository for the project 
- pylint & PEP8

Python skills promoted: 
- Slicing NumPy Arrays
- Using transition probability matrix
- Defining functions & classes in Python
- Combining multiple classes: Composition & inheritance
- How to clean up Python codes using pylint & PEP8 

Techniques used:
- Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)
- Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC)
- One-to-One & One-to-Many Relationships

Data resources: Data from DOODL Supermarket chain for a five-day week indicating where customers spent their time. The data is available [here](https://github.com/PayamSiyahpoosh/DOODL-Supermarket-Chain_Markov_Simulation/tree/main/Extract_Transition_Matrix).
