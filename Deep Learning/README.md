# Deep Learning

Results of the project: 
- An image-classification model recognizing objects that one hold into the webcam.
- Objects are different kinds of eatable and non-eatable mushrooms possible to find in Berlin forest in winter time.

Tools used:
- Tensorflow & Keras (LeNet-5)
- Pretrained Networks (ImageNet, MobileNet, ResNet50)
- Python-libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas

Python skills promoted: 
- Creation of an image data-set & Classifying images with a pre-trained network
- Classifying images in real time using YOLO model
- Building a neural network from scratch
- Training a neural network using a pre-built image dataset
- Processing the images to be used in a machine learning model
- Other: Creation of a virtual environment to manage multiple projects and package installations

Techniques used:
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Backpropagation
- Training Strategies (e.g. activation & loss functions, weight initialization, early stopping)
- Transfer Learning
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) & Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)

Data resources: Own data from Berlin forest for mushrooms classes oyster, green oyster, common porecrust, many colored polypore, hairy bracket.
