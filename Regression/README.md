# Regression

Results of the project: 
- A linear regression model that forecasts daily bike rentals for a given year.
- Results are measured in mean squared error, r2 score, mean squared log error and mean absolute error.
- Mean squared log error (MSLE) turned out to be the most appropriate measurement for the regression results.
- The RMSLE of RandomForestRegressor gave the most accurate score of all regression models.

Tools used:
- Python-libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn: LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor 
- Statsmodels (OLS Regression)
- Preprocessing: Polynomial features, interaction terms, OneHotEncoder, KBinsDiscretizer, MinMaxScaler 

Python skills promoted: 
- Transform Pandas to datetime: Year, month, day, weekday, hour, minute, quarter, week of year
- Improve train test split & feature engineering
- Groupby-function (e.g. date & weather)
- Visualizations: Heatmap, correlation matrix, bar plots, histplot, distplot, countplot 

Techniques used: 
- Machine learning workflow
- Regression models: LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, OLS
