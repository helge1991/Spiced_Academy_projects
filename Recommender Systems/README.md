# Recommender Systems

Results of the project: 
I've built a web application on Streamlit & Flask that suggests different movie recommendations based on users input.

Tools used:
- Streamlit
- Flask
- Python-libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
- Gunicorn

Python skills promoted: 
- Building a web application in Flask & Streamlit from scratch with titles, headers, selectboxes, different plots & charts & colors etc.
- Implementing a simple recommender
- Clustering in Scikit (K-Means)

Techniques used: 
- Unsupervised Learning (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) / Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF))
- Cosine similarity

Data resources: Data from MovieLens available in https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.
