# Time Series Analysis

Results of the project: 
- Machine learning models that predicts short-term temperature forecast in Berlin Tempelhof
- These models are based on weather data from 1876 until 2022
- Time Series Analysis consider trend, seasonal, remainders, lags, and linear regression

Tools used:
- Python-libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn: Train test split, ColumnTransformer, SimpleImputer, OneHotEncoder, KBinsDiscretizer, PolynomialFeatures, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
- Regression: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, RandomForestRegressor, OLS regression

Python skills promoted: 
- Analyzing time series & evaluating forecasts
- Improved exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality
- Plot and inspect the different components of a time series
- Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model
- Compare the statistical output of different AR models
- Test the remainder for stationarity

Techniques used:
- Autoregressive Model (AR)
- Autoregressive-Integrated-Moving-Average Model (ARIMA)
- (Partial) Autocorrelation
- Statistics of Time Series (Stationarity, Hypothesis Testing, Augmented Dicker-Fuller Test, Statistics of the Autoregressive Model)
- Distribution Functions (Poisson, Normal, Bernoulli, Binomial, Uniform, Geometric)
