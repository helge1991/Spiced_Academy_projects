# Spiced Academy projects

### This repository contains my own weekly projects completed on site during the Data Science bootcamp at Spiced Academy in Berlin from January until April 2023. 
The projects involved various data analysis and machine learning challenges in the following areas:

1. Visual Data Analysis: An animated scatterplot visualizes world fertility rates vs. life expectancy throughout the 20th Century, including population tracking.

2. Classification: In this project the use of machine learning predicts passenger survival on the Titanic. It employs feature engineering with a column transformer pipeline to build a logistic regression model.

3. Regression: A linear regression model that forecasts daily bike rentals for a given year.

4. Text Classification: A language prediction model that web scrapes lyrics from artists using Beautiful Soup.

5. Dashboard: Creation of cloud-sales-dashboards in Metabase using AWS RDS & EC2 instances. The project required data queries in SQL and data modeling in
PostgreSQL.

6. The Data Pipeline: Implementation of an ETL job with MongoDB & PostgreSQL, building a Docker-based data pipeline that stores & analyzes social media posts from Reddit.

7. Time Series Analysis: Predictive analytics for short-term temperature forecast in Berlin Tempelhof using trend, seasonal, remainders, lags, and linear regression.

8. Markov Simulation: A program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket using Markov Chains. This project was part of a group work.

9. Deep Learning: An image-classification model that recognizes objects that one hold into the webcam. This project involves models using Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Networks, Pretrained Networks and Transfer Learning.

10. Recommender Systems: A web application on Streamlit & Flask that suggests different movie recommendations based on users input.
